      <h1 class="font-header-xxl">The Science Workshop is an active development space for learning and sharing ideas.</h1>

      <p class="font-body-m">
        Our hope is to share work-in-progress projects from members of the CZI science team, including early stage designs and prototypes, training materials, past webinars, and more. The featured projects on this page are not an exhaustive list of our work.
        These projects are interactive! Feel free to share feedback with our team about any of these featured projects. Folks are encouraged to make pull requests, add comments, and reach out to our team with any questions.
