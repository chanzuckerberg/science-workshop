# Science Workshop

### The <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/science-workshop/">Science Workshop</a> is an active development space for learning, sharing, and iteration.

Our hope is to share work-in-progress projects from members of the CZI science team, including early stage designs and prototypes, training materials, past webinars, and more. The featured projects on this page are not an exhaustive list of our work.

These projects are interactive! Feel free to share feedback with our team about any of these featured projects. Folks are encouraged to make pull requests, add comments, and reach out to our team with any questions.

### Are you an engineer and want to add your own project to the repo?
1. Ask [@Maya Lila](https://github.com/mmmmmmaya) to add you as an editor to this repo
1. Ask [@Genevieve Haliburton](https://github.com/GenevieveHaliburton) to confirm which section your project belongs to
1. Clone this repo
1. Find the `.yml` file in the `_data/` directory which corresponds to your project section
1. Add a new entry to the file
1. Open a pull request and tag [@Maya Lila](https://github.com/mmmmmmaya) as the reviewer

Possible data you can include in your entry:

We aim to have project data for <i>public</i> GitHub repos (such as stars and forks) pulled automatically in the future, and appreciate your patience!
