# Science Workshop

Here members of the CZI science team share work-in-progress projects, including early stage designs and prototypes, along with training materials and past webinars. These projects are meant to be iterative and interactive. We would love to hear from you, and feel free to play around with these projects â€“ make pull requests, comment, and reach out with any thoughts.

The projects in the Science Worshop may not be currently maintained, and may break or disappear without notice.
